### Fundamental SEC 10-K Based Analysis

One of the key topics covered in the AI-Automation-Finance repository is fundamental SEC 10-K based analysis using AI. The SEC 10-K is an annual report filed by publicly traded companies in the United States, providing a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and business operations.

By leveraging AI and machine learning techniques, investors and analysts can automate the process of analyzing SEC 10-K filings to gain insights into a company's financial health and performance. Some of the key areas of focus in fundamental SEC 10-K based analysis include:

* Financial statement analysis: AI can be used to automatically extract financial data from SEC 10-K filings and perform various financial ratios and metrics calculations to evaluate a company's financial health and performance.
* Text analysis: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to analyze the textual content of SEC 10-K filings, such as management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) and risk factors, to gain insights into a company's business operations and potential risks.

In the AI-Automation-Finance repository, you'll find a variety of resources and tools to help you get started with fundamental SEC 10-K based analysis using AI. These include tutorials, code examples, and case studies, as well as links to relevant datasets and APIs. We encourage you to explore these resources and contribute your own knowledge and experience to the community.
